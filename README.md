The project is about using auxiliary data as a third channel to train a model that aims to detect vessels on a SAR image. The collaborators are:

#### Collin - Supervisor
#### Richard - Line Manager
#### Zenyi - Intern

The goals are:
* Analize impact of auxiliary data near shore
* Modify the normalization of the third channel
* Generate accurate shoreline data from the SAR images
* Analyze the pixel value difference and the surroundings of the boundung boxes between false negavitves and true positives
